    \x1b[1mHi there! ðŸ‘‹\x1b[0m

    This project uses \x1b[4myarn\x1b[0m (\x1b[36;4mhttps://yarnpkg.com\x1b[0m) for package management instead of npm.
    This, together with version pinning, ensures a fully reproducible build, even in the future.
    It's also much faster. And who likes to wait when they can avoid it?
